# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: Monday June 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved Symmetric Difference and Exact Change challenges! Also added an input field and search button for the Wikipedia Viewer.

**Thoughts**: Learned a lot about how Array.reduce works!

### Day 3: Sunday June 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked a bit on the Build a Wikipedia Viewer project. It now has a static test search term that returns the correct results and displays to the page. Next steps will be: 1) get the search term as input and search on a button press 2) add functionalty and button for random wiki page 3) style the page. I also spent a good amount of time on the Symmetric Difference challenge. Stumped at the moment, but will pick it up tomorrow with a fresh brain.

**Thoughts**: Trying to figure out how to use the Array.reduce function properly for the symmetric difference challenge... Hmmmmm...

### Day 2: Saturday June 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on Build a Wikipedia Viewer project.

**Thoughts**: Played around a lot with ajax request to wikipedia. Fought my way through a lot of strange errors... until it finally started working the way I want it to. I still don't completely understand why though - will research more.

### Day 1: Friday June 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started doing freeCodeCamp's Advanced Algorithm Scripting challenges (completed 2!). Finished up some functionality on project and added all styling and background images.

**Thoughts**: Regex can be very confusing. It is easy to all of the sudden have a regex that seems way tooooo long. It was very interesting playing around with it to validate US phone numbers correctly. The local weather project was a lot of fun!

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
