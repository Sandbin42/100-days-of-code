### Day 8: Saturday June 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started into the "Use the Twitchtv JSON API" project on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: Got a very decent amount of progress on the project. It is partially functional and formatted. In previous projects I have tried building almost all functionality, and then going back and applying CSS via Bootstrap. This project has called for doing both at the same time as I add pieces to it, which has been a good experience so far.

### Day 7: Friday June 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the Wikipedia Viewer proect!

**Thoughts**: Missed a day yesterday with a busy week, but finished a project today! It is hard to tell the artistic side that I just need to stop playing around with cool CSS stuff and just call it done so I can move on.

### Day 6: Wednesday June 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Wikipedia Viewer a bit. It is now fully functional. Playing around with CSS to give it some style.

**Thoughts**: There is a lot of neat CSS stuff to play with.

### Day 5: Tuesday June 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved Inventory Update challenge! Started on the No Repeats Please chellenge. Worked a bit on Wikipedia Viewer functionality.

**Thoughts**: Thought for a long time and experimented a bit with algorithms to come up with every permutation of a string for the No Repeats challenge. No success yet... will sleep on it. Also... on CodePen... don't forget to hit save when you are done for the night!!! I lost a bit of work from last night thinking the autosave feature would cover me.

### Day 4: Monday June 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved Symmetric Difference and Exact Change challenges! Also added an input field and search button for the Wikipedia Viewer.

**Thoughts**: Learned a lot about how Array.reduce works!

### Day 3: Sunday June 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked a bit on the Build a Wikipedia Viewer project. It now has a static test search term that returns the correct results and displays to the page. Next steps will be: 1) get the search term as input and search on a button press 2) add functionalty and button for random wiki page 3) style the page. I also spent a good amount of time on the Symmetric Difference challenge. Stumped at the moment, but will pick it up tomorrow with a fresh brain.

**Thoughts**: Trying to figure out how to use the Array.reduce function properly for the symmetric difference challenge... Hmmmmm...

### Day 2: Saturday June 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on Build a Wikipedia Viewer project.

**Thoughts**: Played around a lot with ajax request to wikipedia. Fought my way through a lot of strange errors... until it finally started working the way I want it to. I still don't completely understand why though - will research more.

### Day 1: Friday June 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started doing freeCodeCamp's Advanced Algorithm Scripting challenges (completed 2!). Finished up some functionality on project and added all styling and background images.

**Thoughts**: Regex can be very confusing. It is easy to all of the sudden have a regex that seems way tooooo long. It was very interesting playing around with it to validate US phone numbers correctly. The local weather project was a lot of fun!

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
