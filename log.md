# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Friday June 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started doing freeCodeCamp's Advanced Algorithm Scripting challenges (completed 2!). Finished up some functionality on project and added all styling and background images.

**Thoughts**: Regex can be very confusing. It is easy to all of the sudden have a regex that seems way tooooo long. It was very interesting playing around with it to validate US phone numbers correctly. The local weather project was a lot of fun!

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
